# CLam

CLam or "C-Lambda" is a simple interpreter for basic lambda calculus written in C.

Why write this? Mostly just because, but also its a great opportunity for me to learn how bison, flex, and programming languages in general work!

# Running

You will need bison, `flex`, `make`, and `gcc` installed.

```bash
# To build
make

# To run
./bin/clam

```
